| API Routes

| Here is where you can register API routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider and all of them will
| be assigned to the "api" middleware group. Make something great!
|
| Note: This application uses Inertia.js for frontend, so API routes
| are not needed. All functionality is handled through web routes.
